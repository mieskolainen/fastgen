Fast/toy MC generator for exclusive systems (but no proton legs) + 2-body decay

Note that this small tool is basically meant for DEBUG purposes and for other control studies. The 2-body decay is according to the flat phase space measure dLIPS_2. The kinematics of the central system can be made arbitrary within 4-momentum conservation and it is for the user to adjust the sampling, e.g., to follow flat Lorentz invariant measures or some other favourable criteria.

Typical Lorentz frames such as Helicity, Collins-Soper, Gottfried-Jackson (pseudo) and Anti-Helicity are defined within unified operations.
